### Project Overview:
The Crime Analysis Dashboard visualizes crime data, providing insights into crime trends, types, and resolutions. The dashboard includes a variety of visuals to track total crimes, resolved/unresolved crimes, and crime distribution over time and geography. Interactive drill-throughs offer detailed analysis of crime types and time patterns.

### Business Objective:
With rising crime rates, itâ€™s crucial for law enforcement agencies and local authorities to understand crime patterns, track resolutions, and make informed decisions. The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive view of crime data, helping to identify high-crime areas, seasonal trends, and resolution efficiency, ultimately aiding in resource allocation and strategy formulation.

### Data Source:
Crime Dataset
  - [Crimes.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19831355/Crimes.Data.xlsx)
  - [Crime Type.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19831356/Other.Data.xlsx)

### Tools Used:
  - Excel
  - Power BI

### Data Understanding:
  - Crime Data: Contains information about individual crime time and date, country and resolution status.
  - Crime Type: A separate dataset that categorizes the crimes into crime types

### KPIs:
  1. Total Crime, Total Resolved Crime and Total Unresolved Crime
  2. Crime Rate by Month and Crime Rate by Year
  3. Crime Rate by Time Slot (3-hour intervals)
  4. Percentage Change in Crime (Month-to-Month)
  5. Crime Rate by Weekday
  6. Crime Distribution by Country
  7. Crime Rate by Type of crime
  8. Interactive dashboard [View Dashboard](#https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/144d35b9-c7f3-4a9f-a002-0d81c57362f4)

### Data Cleaning:
  - In Excel: Data was cleaned by removing unwanted columns. Additionally, columns were formatted to ensure consistent date/time formats and data types.
  - In Power BI: Data was further cleaned using Power Query, including transforming columns, and ensuring accurate relationships between tables.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  1. **Crime Type Distribution:**
      - Anti-Social Behaviour and Violence and Sexual Offences represent around 60% of the total crime incidents.
      - These two categories indicate a significant portion of the crime landscape, pointing to social issues that need targeted intervention.
  2. **Monthly Crime Analysis:**
      - The crime rate in September and October accounts for approximately 23% of the total crimes.
      - A noticeable spike in crime during these months suggests seasonal patterns or external factors (e.g., festivals, holidays, or environmental conditions) that could be influencing criminal behavior.
  3. **Time-Based Crime Analysis:**
      - 45% of crimes occur between 9 PM and 3 AM, indicating a high concentration of incidents during late-night hours.
      - This is particularly concerning for law enforcement and community safety, as these hours might coincide with increased social activity, lack of supervision, or alcohol/drug-related behavior.

### Power BI Optimization:
To improve the performance and efficiency of my Power BI report, I applied the following best practices:
  - Used a star schema: Structured the data model with fact and dimension tables instead of flat tables to reduce redundancy and optimize query performance.
  - Removed unnecessary columns and rows: Imported only the required columns and filtered out irrelevant rows to minimize memory usage and improve refresh speed.
  - Turned off Auto Date/Time: Disabled the Auto Date/Time feature to prevent Power BI from creating unnecessary hidden date tables that impact performance.
  - Optimized DAX by using measures: Replaced calculated columns with DAX measures wherever possible to improve calculation performance and reduce memory load.

### Data Analysis (Power BI Visuals):
  - Card Visuals: Display total crimes, resolved crimes, and unresolved crimes.
  - Table Visual: Shows monthly crime data, comparing it with the previous month and calculating percentage changes.
  - Matrix: Displays total crime data by weekday and month, providing a breakdown of crime patterns.
  - Map: Geographical visualization showing total crimes by country.
  - Line Chart: Displays the trend of total crime over time (monthly).
  - Bar Chart: Compares total crimes by year.
  - Bar Chart (Time-based): Displays total crimes by time, with 8 bars representing 3-hour intervals.

### Project Insights:
  - **Concentration in Specific Crime Types:** A large proportion of crimes are concentrated in Anti-Social Behaviour and Violence and Sexual Offences, suggesting that public awareness campaigns, community engagement, and specialized law enforcement strategies could reduce incidents in these categories.
  - **Seasonal Trends:** The September and October spike indicates potential factors driving crime during these months. This could be due to local events, cultural holidays, or even environmental factors such as weather.
  - **Night-Time Crimes:** With 45% of crimes occurring late at night, this suggests a need for increased night patrols, surveillance, or community outreach during these hours to curb criminal activity.

### Recommendations:
  - Targeted Interventions: Focus on community policing, neighborhood watch programs, and specialized units for Anti-Social Behaviour and Violence & Sexual Offences.
  - Resource Allocation: Increase law enforcement and community engagement in September and October, monitoring for external factors like holidays or festivals.
  - Night-Time Policing: Boost patrols, use surveillance tech, and offer late-night community support (e.g., safe zones) from 9 PM to 3 AM.
  - Data-Driven Strategies: Regularly analyze crime trends to adjust prevention measures based on patterns and external factors.
  - Community Collaboration: Work with local businesses, schools, and organizations to address root causes and engage at-risk individuals early.

### How to Use This Report: 
  - Use Filters: Apply filters for Crime Type and Country to narrow down the data for targeted analysis based on location and crime category.
  - Track Key Metrics: Monitor high-level KPIs such as Total Crime, Resolved Crime, and Unresolved Crime to assess overall crime activity and resolution performance.
  - Explore Crime Patterns: Use the heatmap matrix (Weekday vs. Month) to identify patterns in crime occurrence across different days and months.
  - Drill Through Time-Based Trends: Click on specific time slots in the 3-hour interval bar chart to drill through and analyze crime types and frequency during that period.
  - Analyze Trends and Changes: Review the monthly line chart for overall crime trends and use the % change column in the table to compare current vs. previous month performance.
